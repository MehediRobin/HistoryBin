> Hello, happy that you have found my little repository here. I am Mehedi, a sucker for knowledge, mostly to waste it. I have made this repository to mark my footsteps on my journey to learn about the history of the world. It will be my great pleasure if any resources, or information shared here come to any help of you.

## 4 billion Years Ago from Today
Origin of life on the earth. Many theories on the phenomena with no sound conclusion. One popular theory is that, at that time, asteroids and other broken cosmic elements were hitting the surface of the earth. Some hit the water and cause molecular transformation. Because of extreme gas in the troposphere, lightning was striking everywhere. Billions of volts of electricity hit the molecule mass in the water at the right time and in the right place causing them to be formatted in a precise pattern and create a bundle of genetic material. A certain type of oily semi-permeable liquid engulfed such genetic materials and created the first living cell.

>Enough for the controversial origin story. In my repository, I will mainly focus on the social and cultural history of humankind. Here is a chronological chart that I will try to cover the entire world history

Timeline of World History  
A timeline of world history can be broken down into the following major eras.

**Prehistory** -	*6 million years ago -- 3600 BCE* -	The study of prehistory focuses on the earliest humans and civilizations. It looks at the characteristics that are necessary for civilization. The Paleolithic and Neolithic eras are examined. The Stone Age is part of this period.  

**Ancient World** -	*3600 BCE--500 CE* -Studying the ancient world includes examining ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Ancient Asian cultures, such as those in China, India, and Japan, are also studied. In the Americas, one may learn about the ancient Mayan and Incan peoples. The Bronze Age is studied as part of ancient history.  

**Middle Ages** -	*500--1500 CE* - The Middle Ages are sometimes referred to as a dark time in history due to the many wars and plagues that were present during that period as well as a relative lack of intellectual pursuits. It extends from the end of the Roman Empire until the beginning of the Renaissance. In the Middle East, Islam was developed and spread as a religious movement that often came into conflict with Christianity, leading to religious wars called The Crusades. The late Middle Ages featured the beginning of European exploration of the Americas and the Golden Age of Islam, which included flourishing intellectual activity.  

**Renaissance** - *1350s--1650s* -	Beginning at the tail end of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance was a time of intellectual and artistic rebirth in Europe. The development of movable type for a printing press in 1436 meant that printed materials could be distributed to a broader audience. There was a massive increase in literacy and the spread of knowledge. The Protestant Reformation, which began with Martin Luther posting 95 Theses on the door of a Wittenberg Church in 1517, led to a split in the Catholic Church. European exploration of the Americas continued during this period.  

**Modern World**	1650--today	The modern world began with the Age of Enlightenment, a time of increasing focus and developments in philosophy, science, and math. During this time, the American and French Revolutions were fought. In the 1750s, the Industrial Revolution began, changing how products were made and impacting how people lived, worked, and traveled. The 20th century was a time of major wars, including World War I and World War II, and technological advances. The Age of Information began in the 1970s with the increased use of computers.

## 11,000 BCE:
1. The beginning of village life in a few parts of the world.
2. The end of the Pleistocene era and the last ice age
