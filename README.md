# 4 billion Years Ago from Today
Origin of life on the earth. Many theories with no sound conclusion. One popular theory is that, at that time, asteroids and other broken cosmic elements were hitting the surface of the earth. Some hit the water and cause molecular transformation. Because of extreme gas in the troposphere, lightning was striking everywhere. Billions of volts of electricity hit the molecule mass in the water at the right time and in the right place causing them to be formatted in a precise pattern and create a bundle of genetic material. A certain type of oily semi-permeable liquid engulfed such genetic materials and created the first living cell.
